## 🔐 Toy Project: Decrypt RSA Simulation using Shor’s Algorithm

### 📌 Overview

This project is a **toy simulation** that demonstrates the basic concept of RSA encryption and classical emulation of **Shor's algorithm** (used for factoring large integers efficiently using quantum computation).
It's built for educational and experimental purposes to illustrate how factorization can potentially break RSA-based encryption systems.

### ⚙️ Features
  - **RSA Key Generation** (prime selection, φ(n) computation, modular inverse)
  - **Encryption / Decryption** using modular exponentiation 
  - **Shor's Algorithm (mock)** – classical brute-force period-finding simulation
  - **Factor Recovery Demo** – simple flow from ciphertext to recovered plaintext

### 🧰 Code Highlights

Function | Description
|--      |--
`RSA_BASE.__init__()` | Generates primes `p`, `q`, computes `n`, `phi`, and keys
`_pick_e()` | Selects an encryption exponent `e` coprime to `φ(n)`
`encrypt() / decrypt()` | Implements RSA encryption and decryption
`find_period()` | Brute-force search for period `r` where `aʳ ≡ 1` (mod N)
`shor_factor_mock()` | Classical simulation of Shor’s factorization
`demo()` | Demonstrates full process — keygen → encrypt → factor → decrypt

### 🧩 Example Execution

Run:
```bash
python rsa_shor_demo.py
```

Example Output:
```bash
=== Step 1: RSA Key Generation ===
p=13, q=23, n=299
e=65537, d=12313

=== Step 2: Encryption ===
Plaintext: "time is gold"
Ciphertext: [encrypted values]

=== Step 3: Factorization Simulation ===
Found factors: (13, 23)
Recovered plaintext: "time is gold"
```
