# 🔐 Toy RSA Decryption via Shor (Mock)

This is a minimal simulation of RSA decryption using classical logic inspired by Shor’s algorithm.

## 📄 What’s inside?

- A single Python script (`RSA_Decryption_Via_Shor.py`)
- Demonstrates:
  - RSA encryption/decryption
  - Period finding
  - Factoring small RSA moduli
  - Full attack flow (from ciphertext to recovered plaintext)

 ☕ Coffee not included, but highly recommended.
